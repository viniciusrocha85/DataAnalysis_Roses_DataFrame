# Statistical Analysis Project - Iris Dataset

This repository contains a statistical analysis project conducted on the Iris dataset. The Python code uses Pandas and Matplotlib to explore statistics, means, standard deviations, correlations, and graphical visualizations.

## Files

- `Project-Infinity-Statistics.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the project code.
- `iris.csv`: Iris dataset.

## Usage Instructions

1. Open the `Project-Infinity-Statistics.ipynb` file in a Jupyter environment.
2. Execute the code cells sequentially to obtain statistical analyses and visualizations.
3. Make sure to have the necessary libraries installed.

## Analyzed Questions

1. Frequency of each class (Setosa, Virginica, and Versicolor).
2. Mean for the width and length of the sepal for each class.
3. Class with the highest standard deviation in petal length.
4. Correlation between sepal width and length for each class.
5. Boxplot for the sepal length of each class.

## Visualizations

Explore the results visually through the graphs generated by the code.
